               My Childhood
            </summary>
            <p>
               I grew up in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. It is near world's longest sea beach. Everyday I played football, cricket with my friends in my school playground. Sometimes we go to sea beach to see the sunset. It is amazing feelings to have a such beautiful sea beach in my town. We played football in sea beach. It was a golden time for me. I miss my childhood.
